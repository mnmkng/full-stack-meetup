# Prague Full-Stack Developer Meetup

## Fast-Forward your Docs with Docusaurus
Not too many developers enjoy writing documentation and building related tools
instead of shipping actual application features. Fortunately, there are ways
to avoid most of the hassle. With a combination of JSDoc, Markdown
and Docusaurus, you can have a stunning documentation website up and running in no time.
